## Getting Started

To explore the Time Series Analysis With Cryprocurrency project in Power BI, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Power BI Desktop (latest version)
- Kaggle dataset (Cryptocurrency data)

### Installation

1. **Download the Dataset**

   - Obtain the Cryptocurrency dataset from Kaggle. You can download it from the Kaggle Cryptocurrency Dataset.

2. **Open Power BI Desktop**

   - If you don’t have Power BI Desktop installed, download and install it from the Power BI website.

3. **Load the Data**

   - Open Power BI Desktop and load the Cryptocurrency dataset:
     - Go to Home > Get Data > CSV (or the format of your dataset).
     - Select the downloaded dataset file and click Load.

4. **Transform and Clean Data**

   - Use Power Query Editor to perform data transformation and cleaning:
     - Go to Home > Transform Data.
     - Apply necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

5. **Create KPIs and Dashboards**

   - Use DAX to create calculations and KPIs:
     - Go to Modeling > New Measure to define new metrics.
   - Design visualizations and arrange them into dashboards.

### Publish the Report
